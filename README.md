# Gravity Wells

A simple gavity sim in SFML based upon Zipped's rendition with the added functionality of creating and destroying gravity sources, pausing/unpausing the sim along with resetting(clearing screen).

Extemely barebones, but decently optimised can handle ~50k particles of radius 07.

(GUI functionality to be added, unfortunate that imgui doesn't work wth sfml, will probably have to use TGUI or other libs)
